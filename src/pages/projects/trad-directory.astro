          <h4>My current tattoo count 10 and counting</h4>
          <p>This project helps people find top traditional tattoo artists by location.</p>
          <p>I started getting tattoos in 2023 and quickly wanted moreâ€”but finding great artists wasn't easy. Most are on Instagram, but searching by location there is rough.</p>
          <p>This is just a searchable database of artists I've found and logged. Simple as that.</p>
