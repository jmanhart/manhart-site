I’m writing this from SFO nearly 13 years after the first time I visted this San Francisco. The first time I landed in San Francisco nearly thirteen years ago I was clueless about what I was doing with my life, professionally and other. As I sit here at gate B12 writing this after my companies annual Design Summit. I am reflecting on that first time I visited the bay.

A few days ago, I was drinking an IPA and swapping war stories with another designer who, like me, went to design school and cut their teeth inthe agency world. We were sitting in the kind of startup commons area you’ve seen a million times, two people were playing pool in the background and we both paused for a min kinda floored by where we’d ended up and where we started.

Back in college I was kinda a punk (and not in a cool way). I took design seriously but during this period I was definetly lost with what I wanted todo in college and beyond. I had recently been dumped and spent the bulk of my time studying the subjects of whiskey, weed and mushrooms, while attending the occasional design critique.

During this time I had taken my first few steps in the world of “digital design” at the time. It was a special topics class taught by an instructor who was only a few years older than me but he was really shaking me up in my studies.

Before that class the program was very deep in the design of book covers, posters and obsessing over the kerning of every letter. Now these are very important topics and learning the creative process it immeasurable but I was fucking bored. I really clicked with this professor and the topic. This instructor later ended up at my bachelor party years later (after college of course) tripping on acid while throwing cheese puffs into our mouths while reading from the Bible…but that’s a different story for a different time.

Anyway, back then Mad Men was peaking on AMC and dominating the mind of every creative director and they all thought they were Don Draper. Agencies were filled with late nights, cheap scotch, and a lot of burnout disguised as “grind.” And if you wanted a job, you had to fight for it. My school ran this internship gauntlet every year where 30 of us would compete for one maybe two intern spots. In this small Missouri town If you missed this train you were fucked.

Every year our Students in Design club would plan a trip over Spring Break. We would do studio tours meet with industry professionals and museum hope. This was the time to plant the smallest of network connections. It was a busy week with every second planned to the detail. This year we were all going to San Francisco and this would also be my first time in the city. Everyone heading out there zigged one way and well I zigged another. I was recently dumped, spinning and had zero clue what the fuck I was doing. The all came out to SF motivated to plant the seeds for the career and well I didn’t.

One of my best friends in this life had moved out to SF the year before and he gave me a spot on his floor for the week and promised me a much needed west coast perspective. He knew I was going thru shit.

By the time we flew back to Missouri, I was broke, confused, and spiraling—but also, something had clicked. I’d caught this tiny glimpse of what the design world could be: creative, weird, soulful. Not just soulless logos and cutting tiny pieces of paper for book covers.

The internship interviews were happening a week later. I figured I had no shot. I hadn’t printed anything. I hadn’t rehearsed a pitch. Everyone else was in the lab obsessing over kerning and portfolio cuts. I was sitting there thinking about how to get back to California to be a full-time beach bum.

That’s when Aimee walked in. A close friend, fellow SF tripper, someone who had always read me better than I could. She saw me slacking and just said, “John, actually fucking try.”

Something flipped with those words.

Everyone was walking in with these massive printed portfolios—books, pitch decks, the whole song and dance. I decided to do the opposite. I stayed up all night pulling together a digital portfolio of the weird app stuff I’d been making for Niven’s class. Clickable InVision mockups, some hacked-together HTML ebooks—janky, but real.
When it was my turn, I walked in with nothing but an iPad. I sat at the table next to four people who all looked at me like I was an idiot. The Creative Director and junior designer came by, a little confused. I introduced myself, handed them the iPad, and walked them through my work. No printed books. No poster designs. Just pixels. They were supposed to spend five minutes with each person. We went for ten. I could tell they were into it.
Five days later, I got the offer.
That internship turned into a full-time gig. Which led to big tech. Which led to startups. Which led to leadership. Which led to me sitting in this airport today, sipping a dumbly expensive coffee and thinking about how that whole thing started because I decided to actually fucking try. Because Aimee told me to.
These days, coming to SF feels different. It’s not psychedelic or romantic—it’s scheduled, strategic, purpose-driven. The hookah nights, brown bags on the beach, and sneaking onto Muni with three roommates are long gone. But that first week? That beautiful mess of a week? That’s the one I’ll always come back to.
I think about that kid a lot. Lost, buzzing with potential, completely unqualified—but just dumb enough to believe he might pull it off.
And he did.
