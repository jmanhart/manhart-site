This past May I finally got the chance to see the first musical group I ever had memories of - the rolling stones. Ever since I could remembed the Rolling Stones had been a constant staple in my life.

Watching my mom, dad and uncle plan their year around the chance that they might get the chance to catch them on the upcoming tour was just always on the table. And if they came within 200 miles it was a gurantee they would be there.

Some people had dead heads in their familes and my family was stones-heads...is that even a term. I dont know but what I am trying to say is the Rolling Stones have always and will always hold a strong presence in my life.

Even in the mid 90's people kept saying "this might be their last tour...this could be the last time to see them". The urgency was very much a factor than so fast forward to 2024 and fucking hell the window seems to be closing, but who knows Keith runs on cheetah blood and immortal so never count him out.

So this is how it played out with negotiations with my brother when the Hackeny Diamonds tour was announced in late 2023 and I have the text recipts as well. It started as "nah they are to old and I might just snag some cheap seats to cross off that I saw them". Well it took very little convincing from my brother to slowly move it up and up and up. A game of chicken I had no problem with losing.

It landed with VIP pit tickets on Keiths side and the amount per ticket was something I will never fully tell to my wife.

We settled on it him and his wife flying up for an action packed weekend capped with the Stones show at Lumen Field in Seattle.

This would be my first time seeing the Stones but it would be the second time for my brother Tyler. The stars aligned perfectly him to tag along for the Bridges to Babylon my parents and uncle. This was something that he has bragged about for years and for good reason cause its fucking awesome. But ever since than it had been a running bit in the family from my dad of him "owing me a stones concert".

Now unfortunaly my dad could not make this show (he is still with us just lives a long way away). His response to not making it was "well just glad you get to see them and with your brother too". Having this minor talking point worked out and the tickets in hand that were nearly more expensive than the first shit box car I had in high school. We were ready...well sorta. We got the tickets in Dec and the show was in May so it was a long fucking wait till than.

I wanted to come in hot for the show. I knew my brother was reaching deep into his closet for an old shirt he had for years "Keith Richards for President" and I knew I needed to come in hot as well.

I remember during a tour a few photos of Keith wearing a shirt with huge letters asking the question "Who the Fuck is Mick Jagger?". This was perfect and fuck is probaly one of my favorite words ever. So boom ordered.

So much waiting the months went to weeks and than to days and than hours. So much waiting. Waiting for the show is always terrible but the day of the show waiting I really like and have for years. People are always fucking stoked the day of a show and the people you meet in line you know you have at least one thing in common so chatting is easy for an extrovert like myself.

Well standing in line with people silly enough to purchase VIP tickets to the greatest rock show on earth are very chatty and very very fucking happy to be where they are at that very instance in the world. We meet so many awesome people before the show getting drunk. I love the fact that I will never meet them again. This tiny connection will always be a connector with a random stranger having an awesome time.

Like I truely do not remember a single name of the people I meet that day but I do remember so many other things. Like the dude who obviously was insanely loaded in his 70's with a girlfriend half his age doing mollie in the pit. I also remember the chill group of friends that could easily be Tyler and I's parents partying with us in line and in the pit the whole night. Or the lady there with her son from SF that had a rolling stones theme'd tattoo sleeve, that was epic.

Everyone we met that night was awesome. Even the person who's final resting place was somewhere near the 50 yard line was awesome. Yes someone dumped a love ones ashs at the show and you know what good on them was a totally bad ass send off.
