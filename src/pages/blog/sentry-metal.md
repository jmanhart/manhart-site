I have always been a metalhead – black, speed, Norwegian, death, DOOM I love it all. So, this year for our annual hackweek I decided to "Metalify" the Sentry logo.

While researching the origins of metal band logos everything ultimatly leads back to one band - Black Sabbath. Mere moments into their debut album, after the church bells had grew to a thunderous cresendo of distorited guitar. A simple question is asked to the listener "What is this that stands before me?".

The album cover also asked this question to the listener well before the needle even dropped though. The cover was a haunting photo of a woman stand along in the woods, adorned by a creepy, bubbly wordmark pinned to the top corner inspired by black lettering from centuries past. This imagery perfectly captured what was in store for the next 40 mins.

Metal has evolved considerably over the past 50 years to include hundreds of different sub-generes and artistic styles. Even here at Sentry asking "what is your favorite metal genere?" in our  `#metal` slack channel yeiled many different results and a few I have never even heard of.

After digging deep into the origins of metal, which included buying that Black Sabbath album at my local record store. I created what could best be described as a _"moodboard-of-mayhem"_ with a wide rangle of examples to draw insperation from.

The last step before drawing a single line was queuing up my favorite [Blood Incantation album](https://youtu.be/voCRlFlj9yA) turning the volume to twelve and after a sufficent amount of blood had pooled within my ears did I feel **fully** prepared to begin.

My initial rough sketching started in Procreate, but quickly moved all the work into Illustrator. I knew having the final work in a vector format would offer me the greatest degree of felxability with variations.

I also wanted to have a few varations of the logo so we could apply it to any medium with ease, and after a few thousand nodes drawn with the pen tool we were done!

At the end of hackweek week we always demo what what we have built. I actually had the idea for my demo video **months** before hackweek even started. The thought of having the entire company watch a video with intense metal music playing in the background greatly ammused me. 

**Watch for yourself**
