I have always been a light mode guy. In fact I love full eye-ball melting brightness for all my rectanlges. Well maybe after ten years of drawing boxes professionally my eyes have partially melted who knows, but recently I decided to make the switch and embrace dark mode. 

It first started with Figma my daily driver design tool _(like everyother designer in 2023)_. But that slowly rippled out to other tools slack, github, sentry and eventually after a few weeks I was fully in the shadows. 
I know I wasn't born in the shadows but I did **finally** adopt it _(sorry for that I really am)_. 

Even though I merely adopted the shadows _(last time I swear)_, I know others have not embraced dark mode. Also, during this transition I was heads down building my new portfolio site, website, blog site, ramblings site whatever you want to call it, but it's the domain you are currently reading these words on. I wanted to be inclusive to all by giving the option to turn the lights on or off.

So **hopefully** you noticed the toggle in the top right corner and have read this post in your prefered mode. If you didnt notice it till now, appologies for the poor user experience and I hope your eyes didn't melt.
