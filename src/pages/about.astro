          I'm John, and I love drawing boxes, thinking about drawing boxes, and discussing efficient ways to design them. I recently relocated to Seattle after spending a few decades in the Midwest. Currently, I'm a Product Design Manager at <a href="https://sentry.io/about/">Sentry</a> and have been with the company for the past six years. Before that, I worked as a Product Designer for <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> and as a UX Engineer in the agency world.
